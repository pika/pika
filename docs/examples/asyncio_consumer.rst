Asyncio Consumer
================
The following example implements a consumer using the
:class:`Asyncio adapter <pika.adapters.asyncio_connection.AsyncioConnection>` for the
`Asyncio library <https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_ that will respond to RPC commands sent
	from RabbitMQ. For example, it will reconnect if RabbitMQ closes the connection and will shutdown if
	RabbitMQ cancels the consumer or closes the channel. While it may look intimidating, each method is
	very short and represents a individual actions that a consumer can do.
