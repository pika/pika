Version History
===============

Next Release
------------

 - Connection failures that occur after the socket is opened and before the
   AMQP connection is ready to go are now reported by calling the connection
   error callback.  Previously these were not consistently reported.
 - In BaseConnection.close, call _handle_ioloop_stop only if the connection is
   already closed to allow the asynchronous close operation to complete
   gracefully.
 - Pass error information from failed socket connection to user callbacks
   on_open_error_callback and on_close_callback with result_code=-1.
 - ValueError is raised when a completion callback is passed to an asynchronous
   (nowait) Channel operation. It's an application error to pass a non-None
   completion callback with an asynchronous request, because this callback can
   never be serviced in the asynchronous scenario.
 - `Channel.basic_reject` fixed to allow `delivery_tag` to be of type `long`
   as well as `int`. (by quantum5)
 - Implemented support for blocked connection timeouts in
   `pika.connection.Connection`. This feature is available to all pika adapters.
   See `pika.connection.ConnectionParameters` docstring to learn more about
   `blocked_connection_timeout` configuration.
 - Deprecated the `heartbeat_interval` arg in `pika.ConnectionParameters` in
   favor of the `heartbeat` arg for consistency with the other connection
   parameters classes `pika.connection.Parameters` and `pika.URLParameters`.
 - When the `port` arg is not set explicitly in `ConnectionParameters`
   constructor, but the `ssl` arg is set explicitly, then set the port value to
   to the default AMQP SSL port if SSL is enabled, otherwise to the default
   AMQP plaintext port.
 - `URLParameters` will raise ValueError if a non-empty URL scheme other than
   {amqp | amqps | http | https} is specified.
 - `InvalidMinimumFrameSize` and `InvalidMaximumFrameSize` exceptions are
   deprecated. pika.connection.Parameters.frame_max property setter now raises
   the standard `ValueError` exception when the value is out of bounds.

**Details**

Python 3.x: this release introduces python 3.x support. Tested on Python 3.3
and 3.4.

`AsynchoreConnection`: Retired this legacy adapter to reduce maintenance burden;
the recommended replacement is the `SelectConnection` adapter.

`SelectConnection`: ioloop was refactored for compatibility with other ioloops.

`Channel.add_on_return_callback`: The callback is now passed the individual
parameters channel, method, properties, and body instead of a tuple of those
values for congruence with other similar callbacks.

`BlockingConnection`: This adapter underwent a makeover under the hood and
gained significant performance improvements as well as ehnanced timer
resolution. It is now implemented as a client of the `SelectConnection` adapter.

Below is an overview of the `BlockingConnection` and `BlockingChannel` API
changes:

  - Recursion: the new implementation eliminates callback recursion that
    sometimes blew out the stack in the legacy implementation (e.g.,
    publish -> consumer_callback -> publish -> consumer_callback, etc.). While
    `BlockingConnection.process_data_events` and `BlockingConnection.sleep` may
    still be called from the scope of the blocking adapter's callbacks in order
    to process pending I/O, additional callbacks will be suppressed whenever
    `BlockingConnection.process_data_events` and `BlockingConnection.sleep` are
    nested in any combination; in that case, the callback information will be
    bufferred and dispatched once nesting unwinds and control returns to the
    level-zero dispatcher.
  - `BlockingConnection.connect`: this method was removed in favor of the
    constructor as the only way to establish connections; this reduces
    maintenance burden, while improving reliability of the adapter.
  - `BlockingConnection.process_data_events`: added the optional parameter
    `time_limit`.
  - `BlockingConnection.add_on_close_callback`: removed; legacy raised
    `NotImplementedError`.
  - `BlockingConnection.add_on_open_callback`: removed; legacy raised
    `NotImplementedError`.
  - `BlockingConnection.add_on_open_error_callback`: removed; legacy raised
    `NotImplementedError`.
  - `BlockingConnection.add_backpressure_callback`: not supported
  - `BlockingConnection.set_backpressure_multiplier`: not supported
  - `BlockingChannel.add_on_flow_callback`: not supported; per docstring in
    channel.py: "Note that newer versions of RabbitMQ will not issue this but
    instead use TCP backpressure".
  - `BlockingChannel.flow`: not supported
  - `BlockingChannel.force_data_events`: removed as it is no longer necessary
    following redesign of the adapter.
  - Removed the `nowait` parameter from `BlockingChannel` methods, forcing
    `nowait=False` (former API default) in the implementation; this is more
    suitable for the blocking nature of the adapter and its error-reporting
    strategy; this concerns the following methods: `basic_cancel`,
    `confirm_delivery`, `exchange_bind`, `exchange_declare`, `exchange_delete`,
    `exchange_unbind`, `queue_bind`, `queue_declare`, `queue_delete`, and
    `queue_purge`.
  - `BlockingChannel.basic_cancel`: returns a sequence instead of None; for a
    `no_ack=True` consumer, `basic_cancel` returns a sequence of pending
    messages that arrived before broker confirmed the cancellation.
  - `BlockingChannel.consume`: added new optional kwargs `arguments` and
    `inactivity_timeout`. Also, raises ValueError if the consumer creation
    parameters don't match those used to create the existing queue consumer
    generator, if any; this happens when you break out of the consume loop, then
    call `BlockingChannel.consume` again with different consumer-creation args
    without first cancelling the previous queue consumer generator via
    `BlockingChannel.cancel`. The legacy implementation would silently resume
    consuming from the existing queue consumer generator even if the subsequent
    `BlockingChannel.consume` was invoked with a different queue name, etc.
  - `BlockingChannel.cancel`: returns 0; the legacy implementation tried to
    return the number of requeued messages, but this number was not accurate
    as it didn't include the messages returned by the Channel class; this count
    is not generally useful, so returning 0 is a reasonable replacement.
  - `BlockingChannel.open`: removed in favor of having a single mechanism for
    creating a channel (`BlockingConnection.channel`); this reduces maintenance
    burden, while improving reliability of the adapter.
  - `BlockingChannel.confirm_delivery`: raises UnroutableError when unroutable
    messages that were sent prior to this call are returned before we receive
    Confirm.Select-ok.
  - `BlockingChannel.basic_publish: always returns True when delivery
    confirmation is not enabled (publisher-acks = off); the legacy implementation
    returned a bool in this case if `mandatory=True` to indicate whether the
    message was delivered; however, this was non-deterministic, because
    Basic.Return is asynchronous and there is no way to know how long to wait
    for it or its absence. The legacy implementation returned None when
    publishing with publisher-acks = off and `mandatory=False`. The new
    implementation always returns True when publishing while
    publisher-acks = off.
  - `BlockingChannel.publish`: a new alternate method (vs. `basic_publish`) for
     publishing a message with more detailed error reporting via UnroutableError
     and NackError exceptions.
  - `BlockingChannel.start_consuming`: raises pika.exceptions.RecursionError if
    called from the scope of a `BlockingConnection` or `BlockingChannel`
    callback.
  - `BlockingChannel.get_waiting_message_count`: new method; returns the number
    of messages that may be retrieved from the current queue consumer generator
    via `BasicChannel.consume` without blocking.

0.9.13 - 2013-05-15
-------------------
**Major Changes**

- IPv6 Support with thanks to Alessandro Tagliapietra for initial prototype
- Officially remove support for <= Python 2.5 even though it was broken already
- Drop pika.simplebuffer.SimpleBuffer in favor of the Python stdlib collections.deque object
- New default object for receiving content is a "bytes" object which is a str wrapper in Python 2, but paves way for Python 3 support
- New "Raw" mode for frame decoding content frames (#334) addresses issues #331, #229 added by Garth Williamson
- Connection and Disconnection logic refactored, allowing for cleaner separation of protocol logic and socket handling logic as well as connection state management
- New "on_open_error_callback" argument in creating connection objects and new Connection.add_on_open_error_callback method
- New Connection.connect method to cleanly allow for reconnection code
- Support for all AMQP field types, using protocol specified signed/unsigned unpacking

**Backwards Incompatible Changes**

- Method signature for creating connection objects has new argument "on_open_error_callback" which is positionally before "on_close_callback"
- Internal callback variable names in connection.Connection have been renamed and constants used. If you relied on any of these callbacks outside of their internal use, make sure to check out the new constants.
- Connection._connect method, which was an internal only method is now deprecated and will raise a DeprecationWarning. If you relied on this method, your code needs to change.
- pika.simplebuffer has been removed
