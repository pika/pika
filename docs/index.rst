Introduction to Pika
====================
Pika is a pure-Python implementation of the AMQP 0-9-1 protocol that tries to stay fairly independent of the underlying network support library.

If you have not developed with Pika or RabbitMQ before, the :doc:`intro` documentation is a good place to get started.
