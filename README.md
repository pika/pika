# Pika, an AMQP 0-9-1 client library for Python

## Introduction

Pika is a pure-Python implementation of the AMQP 0-9-1 protocol that tries
to stay fairly independent of the underlying network support library.

 * Since threads aren't appropriate to every situation, it doesn't
   require threads. It takes care not to forbid them, either. The same
   goes for greenlets, callbacks, continuations and generators.

 * People may be using direct sockets, `asyncore`, Twisted, plain old
   `select()`, or any of the wide variety of ways of getting network
   events to and from a python application. Pika tries to stay
   compatible with all of these, and to make adapting it to a new
   environment as simple as possible.

## Documenation

Pika's documentation is now at http://pika.github.com/

## Pika provides the following adapters

 * SelectConnection   - fast asynchronous adapter
 * AsyncoreConnection - based off the standard Python library asyncore
 * TornadoConnection  - adapter for use with the Tornado IO Loop http://tornadoweb.org
 * BlockingConnection - enables blocking, synchronous operation on top of library for simple uses
 * TwistedConnection  - adapter for use with the Twisted reactor http://twistedmatrix.com

Support for other IO frameworks is on the horizon.

Major Changes since 0.5.2:

 * Pika has been restructured and made to be fully asynchronous at its core and now supports AMQP 0-9-1 only (RabbitMQ 2.0+)
 * There are many method definition changes, class name changes and module changes
 * Asynchronous AMQP commands now take a callback parameter for notification of completion
 * AMQP commands that are specified as synchronous now buffer other calls on the same channel, sending them when the synchronous commands send their response frame
 * SelectConnection is now the recommended connection adapter and shows better performance than the AsyncoreConnection. SelectConnection implements select, poll, epoll and kqueue for event handling
 * TornadoConnection adds a connection adapter for the Tornado IOLoop
 * Client channel flow control has been removed
 * Support for additional AMQP data types have been added
 * More extensive unit and functional tests added
 * Extensive use of logging at the DEBUG level allows for tracing of all internal activity in Pika and all frames sent to and from RabbitMQ
 * Emphasis on code readability and well commented code through-out

Internal changes since 0.5.2:

 * Low level debug logging demonstrates client behavior and can be toggled via
   pika.log.DEBUG boolean value.
 * Classes now implement new style classes
 * Major restructuring of existing modules and classes
 * Universal callback mechanism added, removing events and other callback
   methods
 * Added BaseConenction which extends Connection and builds in default behaviors
   for asynchronous connection adapters.
 * Abstracted content frame handling to its own class, channel.ContentHandler
 * ConnectionState class moved from codec to connection
 * Frame class definitions moved from codec to frames
 * Reconnection strategies moved into own module
 * Global callback manager implemented
 * HeartbeatChecker moved to own module
 * PlainCredentials moved to credentials module for extensibility
 * AsyncoreConnection rewritten to align with BaseConnection
 * BlockingConnection rewritten to extend BaseConnection and added BlockingChannel and BlockingChannelTransport
 * PEP8ification and use more pythonic idioms for areas as appropriate
