Using Pika with a Twisted reactor.

Supports two methods of estabilishing the connection, using TwistedConnection
or TwistedProtocolConnection. For details about each method, see the docstrings
of the corresponding classes.

The interfaces in this module are Deferred-based when possible. This means that
the connection.channel() method and most of the channel methods return
Deferreds instead of taking a callback argument and that basic_consume()
returns a Twisted DeferredQueue where messages from the server will be
stored. Refer to the docstrings for TwistedConnection.channel() and the
TwistedChannel class for details.
