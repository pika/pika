"""Using Pika with a asyncio IOLoop.

This is port of Twisted pika adapter from :pika.adapters.twisted_connection


The interfaces in this module are Future-based when possible. This means that
the connection.channel() method and most of the channel methods return
Futures instead of taking a callback argument and that basic_consume()
returns a asyncion.Queue subclass instance where messages from the server will be
stored. Refer to the docstrings for AsyncioProtocolConnection.channel() and the
AsyncioChannel class for details.

Usage example:
