"""Pika provides multiple adapters to connect to RabbitMQ:

- adapters.select_connection.SelectConnection: A native event based connection
  adapter that implements select, kqueue, poll and epoll.
- adapters.asyncore_connection.AsyncoreConnection: Legacy adapter kept for
  convenience of previous Pika users. It is recommended to use the
  SelectConnection instead of AsyncoreConnection.
- adapters.tornado_connection.TornadoConnection: Connection adapter for use
  with the Tornado web framework.
- adapters.blocking_connection.BlockingConnection: Enables blocking,
  synchronous operation on top of library for simple uses.
- adapters.twisted_connection.TwistedConnection: Connection adapter for use
  with the Twisted framework
- adapters.libev_connection.LibevConnection: Connection adapter for use
  with the libev event loop and employing nonblocking IO
