    The PlainCredentials class returns the properly formatted username and
    password to the Connection. As of this version of Pika, only
    PlainCredentials are supported. To authenticate with Pika, simply create a
    credentials object passing in the username and password and pass that to
    the ConnectionParameters object.

    If you do not pass in credentials to the ConnectionParameters object, it
    will create credentials for 'guest' with the password of 'guest'.

    If you pass True to erase_on_connect the credentials will not be stored
    in memory after the Connection attempt has been made. This means that you
    will not be able to use a Reconnection Strategy successfully if this is
    enabled.
