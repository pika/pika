Move connection.ConnectionState to frames module
Async Consumer implementation template

2.0
Behavioral refactor:

- Backwards incompatible change that drops Python 2.4, 2.5 support
- Adding Python 3 support
- Add support for new features in RabbitMQ 2.4.0
- Add SSL support
- Rework core data handling to support unicode
- Remove existing connection adapter system
- Implement new pattern for use, behavior based use focused on both
  Asynchronous callback passing style and "Pythonic" development.
  - Async:
    - Merge existing connections into one connection system with IOLoop override
      - Supporting internal IOLoop, tornado, twisted
  - Pythonic:
    - high-level blocking on synchronous AMQP commands
    - Generator for receiving messages from Basic.Publish
  - Both available from the same API calling same classes and methods
- API notation closer to AMQP spec for implementation:
  - channel.open
  - queue.delcare
  - basic.publish
  - basic.consume
- *.*Ok frames will only be passed back in CPS use, calling methods like
  queue.declare will return a success indicator and attributes returned in
  the Ok frame will be assigned to attributes of the class.
- basic.consume and basic.get will return a single object with a materialized
  view of the Method, Header and Body frames.
- Build in support for specific broker types and pure AMQP 0-9-1.
