Here goes the list of bugs, limitations, ideas and feature requests.

 o Proper asynchronous API.

 o We should at least pretend that we test the code. Test coverage
   below 80% is a shame.

 o If AMQP broker is dead, return nice and predictable exception.

 o Handle UTF in password/username or message body. At least print nice error.

 o Do something when user/pass is bad.
 
 o As we don't have any reasonable documentation, we should 
   give as many small examples as possible. It's pretty complicated
   to dig in some details, like:
     * how to get number of messages from the queue
       (or in other words: what is the output of ch.queue_declare)
     * how to set message to be persistent
     * how to get/set headers on message

 o SSL support?

 o Cope with deliveries arriving for consumers that aren't
   active. This can happen when basic_recover is called.
